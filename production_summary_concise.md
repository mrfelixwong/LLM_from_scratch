# Production Transformer Deployment

Transform research models into production systems through quantization, deployment strategies, and distributed training.

## Key Optimizations

**Quantization**:
- FP16: 2x memory savings, <0.5% quality loss (recommended)
- INT8: 4x savings, ~2.5% quality loss (production)
- INT4: 8x savings, ~8% quality loss (edge only)

**Deployment**:
- Single: Development/testing
- Batched: High-throughput production (5-10x speedup)
- Cached: Repeated queries (100x speedup)
- Streaming: Better UX

**Distributed Training**:
- Data Parallel: <10B parameters
- Tensor Parallel: 10-100B parameters (requires NVLink)
- 3D Parallel: >100B parameters

## Production Targets

- Latency: <100ms (real-time) to <1s (batch)
- Throughput: 100-1000 req/s
- GPU Utilization: >80%
- Availability: >99.9%

## Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation**: FP16 + batching + monitoring
2. **Optimization**: Caching + safety filters 
3. **Scale**: INT8 + distributed training
4. **Excellence**: Continuous improvement

**Cost Optimization**: Quantization (4x memory = 2x cost reduction), caching (10x speedup), spot instances (70% savings)

**Safety**: Content filtering, bias detection, rate limiting, human oversight

You're now equipped for enterprise-scale transformer deployment.
